## Description
This skill provides assistance with Next.js development, including project setup, component creation, routing, API routes, styling, deployment, and best practices.

## Capabilities
- Create and configure Next.js applications
- Implement page and API routes
- Develop React components optimized for Next.js

- Handle authentication and middleware
- Deploy to Vercel and other platforms

## Best Practices
- Follow the file-system based routing convention
- Use getStaticProps/getStaticPaths for static generation
- Use getServerSideProps for server-side rendering
- Leverage Next.js Image component for optimization
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Commands
- Create new pages: `pages/[route].js`
- Create API routes: `pages/api/[endpoint].js`
- Add components: `components/[component-name].js`
- Configure settings: `next.config.js`
